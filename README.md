# MultiMarioBros
Welcome to the Multi Mario Bros project. Our game is currently incomplete, so no multiplayer features are available but we continue working to improve the codebase and fix it soon...

## Requirements
- You must have either Java 8 or Jave 7 with JavaFX support (meaning jfxrt.jar) installed.
- Apache Ant (optional)
- Apache Maven (optional)
- Eclipse (optional)

## Compile and Run
There are 3 compilation alternatives:
  1. **Manual:** by executing `./compile_and_run.sh` or `compile_and_run.bat`
  2. **Ant Automated:** by executing `ant` in the working folder (a proper **build.xml** was provided)
  3. **Maven Automated:** by executing `mvn compile` and then `mvn exec:java` in the working folder (a proper **pom.xml** was provided)
